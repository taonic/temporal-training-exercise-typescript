# build-course-site.mjs reads every exercise*/solution* dir, so we need the whole
# repo here. The result is staged into /runtime-app with only what the server
# needs at runtime: the runner, the exercise sources it streams into Daytona
# sandboxes, the runtime package.json it uploads, tsconfig, and the built site.
